Hi there! I'm Lorin. I'm a ballet dancer turned engineer. I currently live in Colorado with my fiance and our hound dog, Cosmo. I work as a software engineer and I'm also a graduate student studying electromagnetics/RF engineering. When I'm not working or studying, I love being outdoors. I spend as much time as I can in the Rocky Mountains. I also like to travel and visit national parks. Camping, hiking, fishing, and skiing are some of my favorite travel activities.
