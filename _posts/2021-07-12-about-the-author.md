I'm a ballet dancer turned engineer. My passion for teaching dance morphed into a passion for teaching and mentoring students during my time at Georgia Tech. I continue to serve as a mentor to new hires at my company. I work as a software engineer and I'm also a graduate student studying electromagnetics/RF engineering. When I'm not working or studying, I love being outdoors. I spend as much time as I can traveling and visiting national parks. Camping, hiking, fishing, and skiing are some of my favorite outdoor activities. I also love to read and listen to audiobooks.
