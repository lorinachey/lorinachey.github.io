I am a software engineer at Qualcomm and a Master's student at the University of Colorado - Boulder. I am currently studying Electrical Engineering with a specialization in RF engineering, but I am also exploring topics in optics, physics, and quantum engineering.

During my undergraduate program at Georgia Tech, I got to work on designing a small form factor LiDAR system that will be housed on a CubeSat and deployed from the International Space Station! You can read more about the project [here](http://www.ssdl.gatech.edu/research/projects/tethering-and-ranging-mission-georgia-institute-technology-targit). This project sparked my interest in optics and introduced me to applied research. I've been hooked ever since!

I chose to take a job in industry after graduation, and before applying to PhD programs, to gain exposure to more topics and help me narrow my focus for PhD studies. I'm thoroughly enjoying my courses at CU Boulder thus far and I am excited to start planning for my PhD applications!
