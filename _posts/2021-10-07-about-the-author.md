Hi there! I'm Lorin. I'm a ballet dancer turned engineer. I currently live in Colorado with my fiance and our hound dog, Cosmo. I love being outdoors and spend as much time as I can in the Rockies. I also like to travel around Western Colorado and Utah, camping, hiking, and exploring the desert. I'm looking forward to visiting more National Parks in the West!
