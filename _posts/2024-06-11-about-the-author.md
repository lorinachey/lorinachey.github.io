Before pursuing a PhD, I spent several years in industry developing professional software engineering skills, gaining exposure to large scale software systems, and figuring out where I wanted to develop niche expertise! I am excited to start a new chapter in the PhD program for Computer Science and Robotics at CU Boulder!

During my undergraduate program at Georgia Tech, I worked on designing a small form factor LiDAR system that was housed in a CubeSat and deployed from the International Space Station! You can read more about the project [here](http://www.ssdl.gatech.edu/research/projects/tethering-and-ranging-mission-georgia-institute-technology-targit). This project introduced me to applied research.

At Georgia Tech, I also got involved with Wreck Racing, a collegiate engineering racing team whose primary competition is building a race car on a $2000 budget. There were many junk yard runs, machining sessions, and late nights in the shop. I had always had an interest in automotive applications, but never got to "wrench" on cars as a kid. I was thrilled when I got to GT and realized I could join a racing team, learn to drive a manual transmission, and drive on a closed course race circuit!

Combining my automotive hobby and software skills seemed like a natural progression, but it wasn't until I lost a friend in a vehicle-bicycle collision that I understood exactly what I wanted to do with that combination of interests.

My friend was cycling to work when she was struck by a truck and killed. I have also had a neighbor killed by a vehicle while cycling and for a while, my commute to work took me by a memorial to a 17-year old cycilst from my town who was killed when he was struck by a vehicle that wandered off the highway into the shoulder. I believe that these tragic deaths are preventable with autonomous vehicle technology. In a world with increased interest in walking and cycling rather than driving, I want to be at the forefront of developing and testing systems that save lives!
