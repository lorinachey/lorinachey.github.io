### Software Tools Used
* Altium Designer
* Keysight's Advanced Design System

### Topics Covered
* Reflections and terminations
* Using stack up design and material properties to estimate characteristic impedance
* Cross talk in uniform transmission lines
* Differential pairs and differential impedance
* S-parameters: return loss, insertion loss, common patterns in s-parameters
* Modeling discontinuities: capacitive, inductive, transmission lines, stubs, vias, etc.
* Design for high speed serial links


#### Check out the images below for a sample of some of the signal integrity characterization work I performed during the summer of 2021.
