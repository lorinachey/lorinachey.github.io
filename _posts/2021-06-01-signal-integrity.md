#### Stay tuned for more updates on the signal integrity work I've done this summer!

### Topics Covered
* Signals in the time and frequency domain: rise time and bandwidth
* Keysight's ADS: creating a TDR, measuring s-parameters
* Instantaneous impedance and characteristic impedance
* Using stack up design and material properties to estimate characteristic impedance
* Altium 2D field solver and other field solver tools
* Reflections and terminations
* Cross talk in uniform transmission lines
* Differential pairs and differential impedance
* S-parameters: return loss, insertion loss, common patterns
* Modeling discontinuities: C, L, t-lines, stubs
* High speed serial links
