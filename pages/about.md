I am a PhD student at the University of Colorado Boulder studying under Dr. Bradley Hayes from the [Collaborative Artificial Intelligence and Robotics Laboratory](https://www.cairo-lab.com/) and Dr. Christoffer Heckman from the [Autonomous Robotics and Perception Group](https://arpg.github.io/)! I am working to become an expert in the field of autonomous vehicles with an emphasis on robust AI/ML systems that are explainable and safe.

I initially started graduate school as a Master's student in electrical engineering when I thought I wanted to pursue RF engineering. But one course in robotics and I was hooked! From that point on, I changed my curriculum to support my new goal of becomoing a roboticist. I was lucky to meet Dr. Hayes and Dr. Heckman just a few months before the PhD deadline, and I'm thrilled to be co-advised by them!

### Primary Research Interests
* Diffusion models and generative AI for autonomous vehicles
* Behavior prediction of autonomous agents in collaborative settings
* Explainable AI in Autonomous Systems

### Peer Reviews
*Coming Soon*

### Skills & Strengths
In addition to increasing my technical knowledge through academic coursework and research, I am focused on continued development in:
* Technical writing
* Effective communication and promoting teamwork and collaboration
* Balancing the need to work independently with knowing when and how to seek additional guidance and constructive feedback
* Mentoring and giving back
